<!-- Rahul Suhag

===== -->
I am an assistant professor in Quantitative Marketing at Texas A&M University, with a passion for leveraging data-driven insights to create value for businesses and drive sustainable competitive advantage. My research interests are in the domain of Quantitative Marketing Strategy, with a focus on two research areas: Marketing to Entrepreneurs and Responsible Marketing by Brands. Additionally, I specialize in using various methods for answering substantive questions, including causal modeling, Bayesian Statistics, Machine Learning, and Empirical IO, to generate practical and robust insights. I completed my Ph.D. at UNC Chapel Hill in May 2024.
