### Principles of Marketing (Undergrad course) â€“ Fall 2021

*Excerpts from select teaching evaluations:*

> **"Rahul Suhag is a phenomenal teacher!** I am so happy that I was able to learn from him. Rahul is one of the best business instructors I have ever had. He was extremely patient with all students and their questions. He was persistent in finding a way to deliver the content so that the students would understand the material."

> **"Rahul Suhag lectures passionately** and is ready to answer any question from the students. He also cares about the students, our mental health, physical health, and problems in and outside of the classes. Students can easily access him and build rapport with him!"

> **"I enjoyed Professor Suhagâ€™s lectures very much!** He was always engaging and asking us questions to make sure we understood. He was really big on participation and helping us connect the material to everyday life. He would stop and take extra time to explain a topic if a student was confused on something. He was willing to go above and beyond by giving feedback and offering extra office hours. One of my fave classes! ðŸ™‚"
